# Autocomplete Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds TAB-based autocomplete functionality to the shell using GNU readline library, supporting both command completion and file/directory completion.

## Features

### 1. Command Completion
- **Built-in Commands**: `echo`, `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `pinfo`, `search`, `clear`, `exit`
- **System Commands**: All executable commands available in PATH directories
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically searches through PATH and caches results for performance

### 2. File/Directory Completion
- **Current Directory**: Completes files and directories in the current working directory
- **Directory Indicators**: Adds `/` suffix to completed directory names
- **Hidden Files**: Hidden files (starting with '.') are ignored in autocomplete

### 3. Context-Aware Completion
- **Command Position**: Completes commands when cursor is at the beginning of the line
- **Argument Position**: Completes files/directories when cursor is after a command

## Usage Examples

### Single Match Completion
```bash
# Command completion
nikhil@hostname:~> ec<TAB>
# Result: completes to "echo"

# File completion (assuming alpha.txt exists)
nikhil@hostname:~> cat alp<TAB>
# Result: completes to "cat alpha.txt"
```

### Multiple Match Display
```bash
# Multiple file matches
nikhil@hostname:~> cat a<TAB>
# Shows: alpha.txt alnum.txt
# Cursor stays at: cat a

# Multiple command matches
nikhil@hostname:~> ca<TAB>
# Shows: cat caller capsh (and other commands starting with 'ca')
# Cursor stays at: ca
```

### Directory Completion
```bash
nikhil@hostname:~> cd Doc<TAB>
# Result: completes to "cd Documents/" (with trailing slash)
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created
1. **`autocomplete.cpp`** - Main autocomplete implementation
2. **`Header.h`** - Added function declarations
3. **`shell.cpp`** - Added initialization call
4. **`Makefile`** - Updated to include autocomplete.cpp

### Key Functions
- `command_generator()` - Generates command completions
- `filename_generator()` - Generates file/directory completions
- `shell_completion()` - Main completion dispatcher
- `initialize_autocomplete()` - Sets up readline completion system

### Technical Features
- **Performance Optimization**: Caches system commands to avoid repeated PATH scanning
- **Memory Management**: Proper allocation/deallocation of completion strings
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of directory access errors
- **Word Breaking**: Configured to break on appropriate shell metacharacters

## Testing
The autocomplete functionality can be tested by:
1. Running `make && ./shell`
2. Typing partial commands and pressing TAB
3. Typing commands followed by partial filenames and pressing TAB
4. Testing with hidden files by starting with `.`

## Requirements Satisfied
✅ TAB-triggered autocomplete
✅ Command completion for built-ins and system commands
✅ File/directory completion in current directory
✅ Multiple match handling with common prefix filling
✅ GNU readline integration
